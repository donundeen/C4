from CJ:
-
- using firefox
- good to not go to each museum's site/APIs
- will play with it for a bit, give feedback on navigation
- access to individual museum API information.
- "templates"? vs Library
- Template stable - code doesn't run, so output doesn't make sense : "Html placed here gets passed along."
- include title (and id)in widget header, always
- ordering widgets, to make more sense.
- big stumbling block - when it loads, you see all the options, then they are gone, and you don't know how to get to them.
- drop-down not obvious, don't know to unlock to edit mode to get those options you saw before.
