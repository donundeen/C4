from CJ:
-
- using firefox
- good to not go to each museum's site/APIs
- will play with it for a bit, give feedback on navigation
- access to individual museum API information.
- "templates"? vs Library
- Template stable - code doesn't run, so output doesn't make sense : "Html placed here gets passed along."
- include title (and id)in widget header, always
- ordering widgets, to make more sense.
- big stumbling block - when it loads, you see all the options, then they are gone, and you don't know how to get to them.
- drop-down not obvious, don't know to unlock to edit mode to get those options you saw before.


From JD:

- "add to my library" - "copy" "fork" or "clone"? so it's clear it's not a "favorite"?
- thinking about "research with this tool" = want to search for objects and "collect" them.
- would be cool to keep a journal of my experience using the tools that go into this product. Things I wish existed, improvements, etc.

From SK

- good to have things that people can "drop in to." eliminate setup time
- short windows to do something
- getting used to how things work - seems pretty easy
- making a short video, tutorial.
- crowdsource tutorial?
- show to Johann next
- Dan Phiffer - used to work at MOMA
