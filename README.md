ASK YOURSELF: MVP : what's the MINIMUM I need to do to be able to show this to my friendliest code friends?
- it has to have the basics of inter-communication, 
- it needs to have different pages for different art objects


TODOs:
- MVP: a bit of UI wrapper around each bin.
-- for "insert code" functionality, and any other features we want to have act on an individual bin.
- 'insert code' functionality
-- MVP: for getting data from other widgets
- MVP : implement a URL structure that makes sense, and allows communication btw widgets
-- MVP: and support having different pages with different widgets on them
-- MVP: this will require making sure code runs on the server, but still understand the "Parent Page URL" concept.

- DONE: MVP: be able to send JSON or HTML outputs from any widget
-- need to look at OUTPUT panel, determine if it's html or json
-- or have HTML, and also a JSON section in comments.
-- needs to be as convenient as possible.
-- DONE: there is a <Script class="c4_data"> for holding JSON, and a <div class="c4_html"> tag for holding html content
- MVP: Execute JSBIN Server-side, so we can get the output post-execution. DONE
- user/group/public access levels on widgets
- do some UI work so it's nice to look at:
-- adjustable size widget divs (or size 1,2,3,4 with Masonry?)
- figure out how to show/hide different panels from the parent window
-- default: load in output-only mode
- access the parent window url from within the code
- widget configuration UI
- make sure jsbin contents are saved at the right times, so no work is ever lost

getting data from one bin into another:


console.clear();

$.ajax({
  //* 1. get the JSON representation of the bin
  url: '//localhost/jsbin/goq/latest',
  dataType: 'json',
  //*/
  
  /* 2. get the full HTML output of the bin
  url: '//localhost/jsbin/goq/latest.html',
  dataType: 'html',
  
  // 2.1. including this header gets the HTML *without* the "edit in jsbin"
  headers: { 'x-requested-with': 'XMLHttpRequest' },
  //*/
  
  /* 3. get the JavaScript panel as JSON
  url: '//localhost/jsbin/goq/latest.json',
  dataType: 'json',
  //*/ // note, this depends on that entire js panel being a JSON object. 
  // we need a way for an object get DATA from another panel, whether it is JSON or HTML
  // probably should use OUTPUT panel, but let people put JSON data in in, along with the HTML, then split it out with the import functions...
